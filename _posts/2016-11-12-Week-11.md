title: Week 11

**What did I do this past week?** It's been a busy one. Let's count off:

 - **Sunday**: Ran the [Run for the Water 5K](https://runforthewater.com/) and then caught a flight to Seattle, Washington for Microsoft interview onsites.
 - **Monday**: Interviewed all day at Microsoft, and then met up with some friends working there. Took the midnight flight back to Austin.
 - **Tuesday**: Election day! I landed at 7AM, got home at 9AM, and had class at 12:30AM. I stayed up late for election results.
 - **Wednesday**: Spent most of the day working on the new OOP Project, Life. Then an [ISSS](https://www.isss.io) meeting in the afternoon.
 - **Thursday**: Finished the final stage of the Pascal parser for my Compilers project at a [MAD Hack Night](https://www.txcsmad.com).
 - **Friday**: Got infected with some new cold that's going around the CS department. Not great.

**What's in my way?** This new OOP project feels like Darwin, evolved. 

**What will I do next week?** Finishing the OOP project, and drinking lots of tea.

Inheritance is a really whacky subject. Which constructors are called? What methods are called? What if a method has a different signature in a child class but its arguments can be "promoted" up the type hierarchy? There's so much that can go wrong that I kind of miss Java's default behavior of "everything virtual by default".

I do enjoy the detailed look we take at C++ in this class. Much like Systems or OS (as classes), it's nice to uncover the inner workings of code and examine the underlying behavior. "Is it a copy or a reference?" "Is this wasteful?" "Does it matter?" The more insight we have as programmers, the more questions we can ask about our programs. 

Although learning C++ was certainly daunting the first few weeks of class, I'm now wishing my first formal class in programming *wasn't* about Java. We're able to learn C++, the language, in a linear fashion, and that allows the assumptions we make alonge the way to get cleared up predictably. 

**Tip of the Week:** I'm sure many of you have heard of [*Cracking the Coding Interview*](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478993942&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview), the go-to standard for (student) software developer interview training. [*How Would You Move Mount Fuji?*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Would-Move-Mount-Fuji/dp/0316778494/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1478993827&sr=8-3&keywords=cult+of+the+puzzle) is a similar book that gives a lot of insight into the "puzzle question" trend. It's a pretty fun read and comes with a lot of puzzle questions and answers, and I'd recommend it if you liked CTCI.
