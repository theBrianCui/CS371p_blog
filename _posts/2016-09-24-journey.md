**What did I do this past week?** 

**What's in my way?** There's an OOP exam next week that I'm a little afraid of. I also have part of a Compilers project due.

**What will I do next week?** Writing a very long study guide for this first exam. I need to catch up on Friday's notes.

Here I am, sitting in the San Francisco Twitch.tv office, writting a blog post for my OOP class, after completing some on-site interviews at Dropbox. These last few days have been pretty exciting!
